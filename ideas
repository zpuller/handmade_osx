ideas:

-actual handmade hero is somewhat inspired by old 2d zelda games. i also liked the concept in ocarina of time
of learning the different songs throughout the game. so the idea is to mix these concepts and have a puzzle/
adventure game where you have to learn songs from people and use them in places, however there is more of a 
puzzle/complexity factor because it is up to the player to decide where to play what music, and the decisions
are actually based on musical qualities. for example if you need to learn a harmony to a song that some npc 
knows..
